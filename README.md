# National Park Finder Application

###### This was our first full application project. A group of 4 of us created an application that takes in the user input to find a national park. Then the national park displays all the latest and up-to-date information. We had to use an API for this project. We decided to use Google Maps and NPS API. The technology we used are below:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. jQuery
5. Ajax
6. APIs
7. Foundation Zurb Framework

#### Authors

1. Sean McPheeters - Front End Developer & Designer
2. John Chambers - Front End Developer
3. Andy Roush - Back End Developer
4. Alvin Ayusa - Back End Developer
